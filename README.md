## Alex Law

Looking for opportunities to expand my horizons and develop new skills.  My degree in Multimedia has enabled me to develop good organisation and communication skills and the ability to work well under pressure.

I am often a curious person.  When I received my very first computer at the age of 12 I was fascinated by how it worked.  I would read lots of magazines about computers and eventually after a few months I decided to open up my own computer and educate myself on all the different components that it was made from.

I first discovered the world of coding at the age of 13 through an article about building websites.  After reading a few tutorials I created my own webpage and launched it via Geocities.

As of April 2017 I will begin my journey through a 12 week intensive course at Makers Academy.  My goal is to gain the necessary skills and knowledge from knowing little to no knowledge of coding into becoming a junior web developer.
