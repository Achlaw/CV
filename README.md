Looking for opportunities to expand my horizons and develop new skills.  My degree in Multimedia has enabled me to develop good organisation and communication skills and the ability to work well under pressure.

I am often a curious person.  When I received my very first computer at the age of 12 I was fascinated by how it worked.  I would read lots of magazines about computers and eventually after a few months I decided to open up my own computer and educate myself on all the different components that it was made from.

I first discovered the world of coding at the age of 13 through an article about building websites.  After reading a few tutorials I created my own webpage and launched it via Geocities.

## Skills

### Communication

Good communication is essential in work and in life.  Problems often result from poor and unclear communication.  I find this skill vital especially in pair programming and in teamwork to make sure your partner and your teammates know exactly what needs to be done and what your opinions are on the tasks at hand.  I have used this skill in my work experience to help customers know that I am there to help them.  A positive attitude shows a willingness to help.

### Teamwork

Being able to work well in a team is important especially if members of your team are not your friends.  The main goal of a team is to get tasks done together.  Having the ability to put your team first and showing respect for all the different opinions with clear communication is essential to a good team.  Having pair programmed with a variety of people and working in different teams throughout my work experience I have a deeper understanding in what an efficient team is like.

### Self motivation

Quite often I am left with tasks and problems to solve on my own.  To tackle these issues I will research different approaches or possible solutions to solve the problems or tasks.  In most situations I am put out of my comfort zone in managing how I handle problems that are not in my favour.  I will try my best of my ability to deal with these problems.  In learning to code I discovered the best way to learn is to challenge myself.
